#         Key Metrics:
#         - 'Impressions': The number of times a post was shown.
#         - 'Engagements': Total interactions (likes, comments, shares, clicks).
#         - 'New Followers': detailed in the daily profile stats.
        
#         Tables:
#         - `fct_daily_post_statistics`: Aggregated metrics per day. Use this for high-level trends over time.
#         - `fct_daily_profile_statistics`: Detailed metrics per post per day. Use this when asked about specific posts, content types, or "top performing" posts.
#         - `dim_date`: Use for calendar-based analysis (weekends vs weekdays).
        
#         Notes:
#         - When asked for "recent" performance, assume the last 30 days unless specified.
#         - "Engagement Rate" is typically Engagements / Impressions.
